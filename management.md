The semaphore colour code is used to display if a given method was successfully ran, if it failed or not performed yet. 

Clicking INFO will bring the dataset and data collection page. In this page it is possible to browse data analysis results and logs for each dataset, overview experimental and beamline paramters, view fragment soaking information and access the reciprocal lattice viewer (if DIALS was used for data processing)
